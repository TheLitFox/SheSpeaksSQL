### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on - Creating and developing my portfolio.<br>
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning - ALL things Data Analytics using Coursera, LinkedIn, & Codecademy!<br>
ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on - Pretty much anything that will help me get my feet wet in SQL, Python, Alteryx, and Tableau.<br>
ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with - a sense of direction? Ha! I've been in Analytics for a few years, but limited to Excel only. Divig in deeper has been like drinking from a firehose!<br>

âš¡ Fun fact: I take my weirdo status very seriously. I'm a tarot enthusiast, hula hooper, and dreadlock artist... if it's weird & random... I've probably done it.
